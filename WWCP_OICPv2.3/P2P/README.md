# OICP Peer-2-Peer Services

This software implements the _Open InterCharge Protocol (OICP)_, which is
defined and used by Hubject GmbH, but instead of sending all data through a
central clearing house this implementation relies on **Peer-2-Peer**
communication between charge point operators (CPOs) and e-mobility
providers (EMPs) in electric mobility.
